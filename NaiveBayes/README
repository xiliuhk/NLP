I did not collaborate with other individuals.
I employed outside resources.
Additional data for bonus task 1: https://github.com/bmccann/party_predictor/tree/master/data
The list of stopword: http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords

I completed the two bonus task.
- Bonus 1 with more instances (significantly improved performance on test.txt)
  Original new data are included in bonus_data
  Bonus1.py for extract and label each speech
  newTrain.txt and newTrain2.txt contain both new data and data provided in class
- Bonus 2 with two experiments
  Remove stopwords and UNKNOWNWORDS (no improvement)
  Bigrams instead of tokens (accuracy, precision, and recall are improved to 1.0)
